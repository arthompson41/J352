<p>Marylanders voted to pass a referendum in the Nov. 2022 election that legalizes recreational marijuana for adults 21 and over in the past general election; however, Marylanders may not be able to purchase the recreational drug for a while.  </p>

<p>A ballot initiative or referendum is when the public votes on if a law or amendment should be implemented rather than the legislative government creating a law. Each referendum needs a simple majority to pass in November.</p>

<p>Maryland, along with Missouri, will be the 20th and 21st states to legalize recreational marijuana. The referendum passed with almost 67% of the vote, almost 33% of voters rejected the referendum, according to New York Times projections.

<p>After a session-long debate on cannabis legalization frameworks in the spring, the Maryland General Assembly voted to put a cannabis legalization question on the ballot for the election.</p>


<p>People 21 and over within the state of Maryland can possess 1.5 ounces of recreational marijuana and two plants starting July 1, 2023. The original legislation wrote Maryland residents 21 and older can possess up to 1.5 ounces of cannabis starting Jan. 1, 2023.</p>

<p>But starting July 1, 2023, after the general assembly has further outlined the state’s cannabis regulations, Marylanders aged 21 and over can possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis with no criminal penalties. If a person is found in possession of more than that, there could be criminal charges, Feldman said.</p>

<p>But widespread access to recreational cannabis dispensaries may take some time, Feldman said. Maryland legalized medical cannabis in 2014, but the drug was not made available to patients until 2017.</p>

<p>“You can pass [the referendum] but then all these other things had to happen,” Feldman said. “There were lawsuits that challenged the way the [medical] licenses were rolled out, and that delayed it even further.”</p>

<p>Feldman said the general assembly will reconvene in early 2023 and start establishing licensing laws for growing, operating dispensaries, testing and transporting cannabis if the referendum passes.</p>


<p>Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) voted for this November’s ballot referendum but was against the proposed ounce limit. He said it falls short of providing reparative justice for Black and brown communities.</p>

<!-- This is my callout -->

<div class="callout secondary" style="font-size:1.5rem; background-color: #AFE1AF">“When we talk about the racist drug war, oftentimes people are arrested and incarcerated and charged for drug paraphernalia,” said Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) said. </div>


<p>Some advocacy groups and activists had hoped cannabis legalization frameworks in the state would account for the disproportionate impact of nonviolent drug convictions on people in the state. </p> 


<p>The Montgomery County senator is reintroducing his bill from the 2022 legislative session to the general assembly this spring aiming to expunge records of people who were convicted of possessing cannabis and people who are currently arrested for possession.</p>

<p>Acevero wants to promote equity in the cannabis industry and allow people to be able to grow cannabis at home as well as decriminalize drug paraphernalia.</p>

<p>“When we talk about the racist drug war, oftentimes people are arrested and incarcerated and charged for drug paraphernalia,” Acevero said.</p>

<p>However, the University of Maryland will not permit cannabis use on campus after Marylanders 21 and over can possess it in July. </p>

<p>Under federal law, recreational marijuana is classified as a controlled substance, along with heroin and LSD. Since cannabis is illegal under federal law, people 21 and over can’t use it on campus. </p>

<p>University of Maryland falls under the jurisdiction of The Federal Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. This law requires higher education institutions to establish policies addressing unlawful drug use even if the drug is legal in that state. </p>

<p>“Our policies and practices related to cannabis use will not change when the new law takes effect,” Bond wrote in the email.</p>
